The city has been walled up from the outside. You are stuck with breathless Crawlers roaming as far as the eye can see. You are surrounded by strangers, and the only thing left to do is survive. You canâ€™t give up now.

Shoot, Loot, Survive.

Breathless is my survival horror role-playing game where you play as Survivors trying to stay alive in a walled city full of Crawlers (zombies).

The entire game can be printed at home making it perfect for a cozy zombie killing one shot!

If you are still undecided about getting Breathless, take a look at this outstanding review of the game by @/aaronsxl.

It goes over the setting and the mechanics in a very thorough way!
