Nomadic uses the Breathless system, so every single action you take brings you one step closer to a complication.

The game is harsh, and beautiful at the same time. Explore, document, but most importantly, survive.

Nomad #647 logging in. I've just entered a new planet's orbit. I'm going to name this one Abori IV. So far, the atmosphere seems OK, but I'll need to land to collect more data.

Haven't heard from the other Nomads in weeks, my suit is showing signs of wear and tear, and my ship is going to need some fuel soon. Hopefully, this planet will have enough resources to keep me going.
