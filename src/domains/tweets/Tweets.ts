The Charge Party Extra by @therabidbanana is a fantastic addition to the core game.

It uses a Party Sheet to help track the assets the group has and how the world seems them.

Using this makes it SO MUCH EASIER to define the position/effect of action rolls.

If you're looking for an additional way to represent dangerous threats in your Charge game, checkout the Threat Level extra by Othelarian.

It uses a new and interesting mechanic that acts like an opposed dice pool and hinders the player's efforts.
